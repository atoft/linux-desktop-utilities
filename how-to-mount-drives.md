An easy way to mount other disk drives (e.g Windows and shared NTFS drives) in GNOME, so they appear in the home directory.

- Go to Applications > Disks.
- Select the data partition of the drive you want to use.
- Go to Cog > Edit Mount Options.
- Uncheck User Session Defaults. 
- Give a friendly Display Name. 
- For Identify As, choose the `by-label` option.
- Specify the mount point as `/home/your-username/your-drivename`.
- Reboot.
