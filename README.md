Personal bits and pieces for Linux.

Use at your own risk. 

- `quickinstall.sh` installs Ubuntu packages that I like to use, including some non-free software. It also sets up a default GNOME session without the Ubuntu additions.
- `nvidia-screen-tearing.md` for how to fix screen-tearing when using nVidia drivers.
- `how-to-mount-drives.md` for how to easily mount NTFS drives in Ubuntu.
