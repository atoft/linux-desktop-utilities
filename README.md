Personal bits and pieces for Linux.

Use at your own risk. 

- `quickinstall-*.sh` installs packages that I like to use, including some non-free software. For Ubuntu, it also sets up a default GNOME session without the Ubuntu additions.
- `emacs/` for my Emacs setup.
- `rclone/` for my Rclone scripts.
- `fedora-nvidia.sh` to install nVidia proprietary drivers on Fedora.
- `nvidia-screen-tearing.md` for how to fix screen-tearing when using nVidia drivers.
- `how-to-mount-drives.md` for how to easily mount NTFS drives in GNOME.
- `misc.md` for other helpful stuff.
